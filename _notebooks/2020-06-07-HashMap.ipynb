    "We used arrays to implement our hashmaps because arrays offer $O(1)$ time complexity for both put and get operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: in case of arrays put is simply `arr[i] = 5` and get is `height = arr[5]`*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Put Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the put operation, we first figure out the bucket index. Calculating the hash code to figure out the bucket index takes some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After that, we go to the bucket index and in the worst case we traverse the linked list to find out if the key is already present or not. This also takes some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the time complexity for any algorithm as a function of the input size `n`, we first have to determine what our input is. In this case, we are putting and gettin key value pairs. So, these entries i.e. key-value pairs are our input. Therefore, our `n` is number of such key-value pair entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: time complexity is always determined in terms of input size and not the actual amount of work that is being done independent of input size. That \"independent amount of work\" will be constant for every input size so we disregard that.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In case of our hash function, the computation time for hash code depends on the size of each string. Compared to number of entries (which we always consider to be very high e.g. in the order of $10^5$) the length of each string can be considered to be very small. Also, most of the strings will be around the same size when compared to this high number of entries. Hence, we can ignore the hash computation time in our analysis of time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, the entire time complexity essentialy depends on the linked list traversal. In the worst case, all entries would go to the same bucket index and our linked list at that index would be huge. Therefore, the time complexity in that scenario would be $O(n)$. However, hash functions are wisely chosen so that this does not happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "`On average, the distribution of entries is such that if we have n entries and b buckets, then each bucket does not have more than n/b key-value pair entries.` \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, because of our choice of hash functions, we can assume that the time complexity is $O(\\dfrac{n}{b})$.\n",
    "This number which determines the `load` on our bucket array `n/b` is known as load factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we try to keep our load factor around or less than 0.7. This essentially means that if we have a bucket array of size 10, then the number of key-value pair entries will not be more than 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens when we get more entries and the value of our load factor crosses 0.7?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In that scenario, we must increase the size of our bucket array. Also, we must recalculate the bucket index for each entry in the hashn map.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: the hash code for each key present in the bucket array would still be the same. However, because of the compression function, the bucket index will change.* \n",
    "\n",
